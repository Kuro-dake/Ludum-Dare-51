Hi dark bunny.|bird|
Oh! hey bunny! hey bird! how's life? I mean - except very very short. Haha|mathbuni|
sorry. a little creator humor.|mathbuni|
So, what can i do for you two?|mathbuni|
well... you know, don't you? you know everything.|buni|
well, yes. but it's good manners to ask anyway.|mathbuni|
so... 0.046875 bird/human seconds, right?|mathbuni|
yes sir!|bird|
i don't want to to dissapoint you, but it's a very arbitrary thing.|mathbuni|
you see, when I was creating the 'Bunny-is-going-places-verse', i liked a certain rhythm.|mathbuni|
but they said: "it has to be every ten seconds"|mathbuni|
and I was like "the hell it has to"|mathbuni|
so i created a bunny second|mathbuni|
really? that's it?|buni|
yes.|mathbuni|
...|bird|
...|buni|
...|mathbuni|
well, anyway, sorry to bother you. we'll be going then|buni|
