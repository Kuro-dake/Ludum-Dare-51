Oops... sry...|bird_sit|||0|254|
Thank you.|buni|
So what brings you two here?|mathbuni|
So: I'm having trouble explaining this to bird.|buni|
You know how when you're doing 'Bunny is going places', and you have to jump between the platforms, and pick the correct vegetables so the spell stays intact.|buni|848|
Sure.|mathbuni|
... and you have to dance all the time you're in the 'Bunny-is-going-places-verse'. And you have to jump-dance every ten seconds exactly, because otherwise it dispels and you return to where you started...|buni|848|
Yeeeeeees...?|mathbuni|
It's not ten seconds math bunny. It's barely half of a second, if even that.|bird_sit|||0|254|
Ah! Good thing you came to me then! I'll gladly explain!|mathbuni|
You see bird, we're talking bunny seconds here! Bunny seconds are much shorter than human or bird seconds.|mathbuni|
I did the math the other day for another bird friend of mine. You have to jump-dance exactly at 128 human/bird BPM. That means you have to jump-dance precisely every 0.46875 human/bird seconds.|mathbuni|848|
And 0.46875 human/bird seconds is exactly ten bunny seconds, so that means one bunny second equals zero point zero four six eight seven five human/bird seconds. Are you following me?|mathbuni|848|
Aaaah... now it makes sense!|bird_sit|||0|254|
Well ... I mean... kind of?|bird_sit|||0|254| 
Why does one bunny second equal to 0.046875 human/bird seconds?|bird_sit|||0|254|
Beats me... I'm not much of a philosopher. I just do the math.|mathbuni|
Hmmm....|buni|
Hot bunny is kind of a philosopher. What do you say we go ask Hot bunny?|buni|
Ooooh! I haven't seen hot bunny in ages! Yeah! Let's go visit hot bunny!|bird_sit|||0|254|
You going to see hot bunny? Hot bunny is hot!|mathbuni|
Yeah!|bird_sit|||0|254|
Yeah! Hot bunny is easily the hottest bunny I know!|buni|
Say hi to hot bunny for me please!|mathbuni|
You bet!|buni|
So, meet you at the hot bunny's place bird?|buni|
Sure.|bird_sit|||0|254|
Okay.|buni|
